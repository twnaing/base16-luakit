# base16-luakit

This repository is meant to work with [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16).

It provides a simple template that can be used with the base16 color schemes to generate a functional config file for [LuaKit](https://luakit.github.io), a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI.

The themes have been built using [base16-builder-python](https://github.com/InspectorMustache/base16-builder-python).
